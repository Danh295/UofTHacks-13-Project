# Money Bird

Your very own financial wingman.

> _We were founded in 2026. Danny, Jerry, Yuhan and Catherine. Not because the world needs more tools, but because we ourselves once stood in the midst of life, unsure of where to fly. We are all different heights—175 cm, 170 cm, 166.5 cm, 157.2 cm. But in reality, no one is truly taller. Some of us come from China, some from Indonesia, and some were born in Canada, yet all grew up under the same expectations of Chinese families. In Toronto and Markham, we learned how to switch between languages, survive across cultures, and maintain a balance between dreams and responsibilities. We know what it means to have no way out. We know that bank account numbers are not just numbers, but represent sleepless nights, mornings too afraid to open the banking app, and the contradictory mix of anticipation and fear for the future. No one taught us how to manage our emotions and finances simultaneously. The world only demands that you hold on, calculate carefully, and avoid mistakes. Few ask: Are you okay? So we started this project. Not for perfection, but for honesty. It's not about control, but about giving people wings to maintain their balance. We believe technology can be gentle, data can be respected, mistakes can be accepted, and a sense of security is the most important prerequisite before any choice. We come from different starting points, but we are heading in the same direction—to help people stand firm in chaos, to no longer feel alone under pressure, and to not rush to fly before they are ready._

## Inspiration

As university students, we constantly see friends and classmates struggling with money in silence. Tuition, rent, credit cards, and job uncertainty create stress that feels personal and isolating. We wanted to build something we would actually use ourselves: a place to talk through financial stress without judgment, pressure, or needing to already “know what to do.”

## What it does

MoneyBird is a financial support companion designed for moments when money feels overwhelming. Users can talk openly about their situation, and MoneyBird listens first, understands emotional context, and then helps break financial problems into manageable, realistic next steps. It focuses on clarity and calm rather than rigid advice.

## How we built it

We built MoneyBird as a full-stack web application. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive interface. The backend uses FastAPI and LangGraph to orchestrate multiple AI agents, including an emotional intake agent, a financial reasoning agent, and a synthesizer that adjusts responses based on user stress levels. Supabase is used for session persistence, conversation history, and agent logging.

## Challenges we ran into

One of our biggest challenges was managing complexity without overwhelming the user. Financial guidance is not just about numbers; emotional state matters. We also faced technical challenges coordinating multiple agents, handling state across conversations, and resolving real-world issues like dependency conflicts, version mismatches, and merge conflicts under time pressure.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We’re proud of building a system that treats financial stress as both an emotional and practical problem. We successfully implemented a multi-agent architecture with clear state management and logging, and we designed a user experience that feels supportive rather than intimidating. Most importantly, we built something we genuinely believe could help people.

## What we learned

We learned that good AI systems are as much about orchestration and safety as they are about model output. Separating concerns between emotional understanding, financial reasoning, and final response generation made the system more controllable and humane. We also gained hands-on experience with full-stack integration, agent coordination, and collaborative development under real constraints.

## What's next for MoneyBird

Next, we want to improve personalization, integrate user authentication, and expand long-term progress tracking. We also plan to refine safety features, improve financial education prompts, and explore partnerships that could make MoneyBird accessible to more students and young professionals.
